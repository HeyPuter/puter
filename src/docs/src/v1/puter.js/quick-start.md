# Quick Start

To get started, you only need the Puter.js SDK to your web application. There is no need for configuration, keys, passwords, ...
Simply add Puter.js to your code and you're good to go:

```html
<script src="https://js.puter.com/v1/"></script>
```

## Example Project
We have created an example project to demonstrate the different functionalities that Puter.js provides. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/HeyPuter/notepad" target="_blank">here</a>.
