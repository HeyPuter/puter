/**
 * Rules for what a GUI popup may hand back to the site that opened it.
 *
 * A popup boot (`?embedded_in_popup=true`) mints a user-app token on several
 * different paths — the plain token exchange, first-visit temp-user creation,
 * and manual signup when temp users are refused — and historically every one of
 * them posted `puter.token` to the opener. The SDK's global message listener
 * feeds that straight into `setAuthToken()`, so posting it signs the site in.
 *
 * That is only what the user asked for when the popup's whole purpose was
 * signing in. `request-permission` popups must not do it: the user is deciding
 * about a single permission, not handing over their account. Posting the
 * failure message is just as unsafe, since its `token: null` would clobber a
 * token the site already holds.

/**
 * Whether a popup running `action` may post `puter.token` to its opener.
 *
 * The token exchange itself still runs for the excluded actions — it bootstraps
 * the app row a permission grant needs and caches `host_app_uid` — only the
 * hand-off to the opener is suppressed.
 *
 * @param {string|null|undefined} action - The popup's `action`, as parsed from
