// TogetherAI Cost Map
// Note: TogetherAI uses dynamic pricing fetched from their API. This map only includes static/hardcoded test models.
// For production, model costs should be fetched dynamically via the Together API.
//
// Most TogetherAI models are not listed here due to dynamic pricing.
// Only hardcoded test models are included.
