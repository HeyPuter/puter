# Contribute code

If you'd like to contribute code to Puter, you need to fork the project and submit a pull request. If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project, we recommend reading this short guide by GitHub on [how to contribute to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

We'll review your pull request and work with you to get your changes merged into the project.

## Your first code contribution

We maintain a list of issues that are good for first-time contributors. You can find these issues by searching for the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter). These issues are designed to be relatively easy to fix, and we're happy to help you get started. Pick an issue that interests you, and leave a comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it.

## Documentation for Contributors

See [doc/contributors/index.md](./doc/contributors/index.md) for more information.

## Code Review

Once you've submitted your pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. We may suggest some changes or improvements. This is a normal part of the process, and your contributions are greatly appreciated!

<br>

## Contribution License Agreement (CLA)

Like many open source projects, we require contributors to sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your code. When you open a pull request for the first time, a bot will automatically add a comment with a link to the CLA. You can sign the CLA electronically by following the link and filling out the form.
