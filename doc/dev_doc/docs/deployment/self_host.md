# Self-Hosting Puter

> [!WARNING]
> The self-hosted version of Puter is currently in alpha stage and should not be used in production yet. It is under active development and may contain bugs, other issues. Please exercise caution and use it for testing and evaluation purposes only.

### Self-Hosting Differences
Currently, the self-hosted version of Puter is different in a few ways from [Puter.com](https://puter.com):
- There is no built-in way to access apps from puter.com (see below)
- Several "core" apps are missing, such as **Code** or **Draw**
- Some assets are different

Work is ongoing to improve the **App Center** and make it available on self-hosted.
Until then, it is still possible to add apps using the **Dev Center** app.

## Configuration

Running the server will generate a configuration file in one of these locations:
- `config/config.json` when [Using Docker](#using-docker)
- `volatile/config/config.json` in [Local Development](#local-development)
- `/etc/puter/config.json` on a server (or within a Docker container)

### Domain Name

To access Puter on your device, you can simply go to the address printed in
the server console (usually `puter.localhost:4100`).

To access Puter from another device, a domain name must be configured, as well as
an `api` subdomain. For example, `example.local` might be the domain name pointing
to the IP address of the server running puter, and `api.example.com` must point to
this address as well. This domain must be specified in the configuration file
(usually `volatile/config/config.json`) as well.

See [domain configuration](#configuring-domains-for-self-hosted-puter) for more information.

### Configure the Port

- You can specify a custom port by setting `http_port` to a desired value
- If you're using a reverse-proxy such as nginx or cloudflare, you should
  also set `pub_port` to the public (external) port (usually `443`)
- If you have HTTPS enabled on your reverse-proxy, ensure that
  `protocol` in config.json is set accordingly

### Default User

By default, Puter will create a user called `default_user`.
This user will have a randomly generated password, which will be printed
in the development console.
A warning will persist in the dev console until this user's
password is changed. Please login to this user and change the password as
your first step.

## Configuring Domains for Self-Hosted Puter

### Local Network Configuration

#### Prerequisite Conditions

Ensure the hosting device has a static IP address to prevent potential connectivity issues due to IP changes. This setup will enable seamless access to Puter and its services across your local network.

#### Using Hosts Files

The hosts file is a straightforward way to map domain names to IP addresses on individual devices. It's simple to set up but requires manual changes on each device that needs access to the domains.

##### Windows
1. Open Notepad as an administrator.
2. Open the file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add lines for your domain and subdomain with the server's IP address, in the
   following format:
   ```
   192.168.1.10 puter.local
   192.168.1.10 api.puter.local
   ```

##### For macOS and Linux:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Edit the hosts file with a text editor, e.g., `sudo nano /etc/hosts`.
3. Add lines for your domain and subdomain with the server's IP address, in the
   following format:
   ```
   192.168.1.10 puter.local
   192.168.1.10 api.puter.local
   ```
4. Save and exit the editor.


#### Using Router Configuration

Some routers allow you to add custom DNS rules, letting you configure domain names network-wide without touching each device.

1. Access your routerâ€™s admin interface (usually through a web browser).
2. Look for DNS or DHCP settings.
3. Add custom DNS mappings for `puter.local` and `api.puter.local` to the hosting device's IP address.
4. Save the changes and reboot the router if necessary.

This method's availability and steps may vary depending on your router's model and firmware.

#### Using Local DNS

Setting up a local DNS server on your network allows for flexible and scalable domain name resolution. This method works across all devices automatically once they're configured to use the DNS server.

##### Options for DNS Software:

- **Pi-hole**: Acts as both an ad-blocker and a DNS server. Ideal for easy setup and maintenance.
- **BIND9**: Offers comprehensive DNS server capabilities for complex setups.
- **dnsmasq**: Lightweight and suitable for smaller networks or those new to running a DNS server.

**contributors note:** feel free to add any software you're aware of
which might help with this to the list. Also, feel free to add instructions here for specific software; our goal is for Puter to be easy to setup with tools you're already familiar with.

##### General Steps:

1. Choose and install DNS server software on a device within your network.
2. Configure the DNS server to resolve `puter.local` and `api.puter.local` to the IP address of your Puter hosting device.
3. Update your router's DHCP settings to distribute the DNS server's IP address to all devices on the network.

By setting up a local DNS server, you gain the most flexibility and control over your network's domain name resolution, ensuring that all devices can access Puter and its API without manual configuration.

### Production Configuration

Please note the self-hosting feature is still in alpha and a public production
deployment is not recommended at this time. However, if you wish to host
publicly you can do so following the same steps you normally would to configure
a domain name and ensuring the `api` subdomain points to the server as well.
